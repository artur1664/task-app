### Original description:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar
spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

### I think:
1x$50 is incorrect and should be 1x$70 (purchase was 120$) so final result should be 110 points
